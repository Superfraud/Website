<h1>Welcome to website about politics for my creative project.</h1>
<p>I'm going to be updating this as I polish the code.</p>
<p>I am going to have 5 pages: the home webpage (this), a page for the 3 biggest parties: Labor, Conversatives and the Liberal Democrats. 
I will also have a webpage for smaller parties and independent MPs. </p>
